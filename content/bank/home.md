title: The Wrong Place
---
# Intro

Welcome to Ethan's awful website that is long overdue. You are most definitely in the wrong place.

## Summaries
Here, I write summaries for school subjects, with the aim of making revision a lot easier. Each summary is oriented around a topic, and is complete for quick cramming.
- Topic and content introduced for assignment/test
* Example questions to explain ze content
+ Step-by-step how to answer different exam questions
- Practice Resources or even **original past papers**

I plan to focus the summaries effort on
1. [Maths Methods (Yr 12)](/bank/ATMAM.md)
2. Maths Spec
3. Physics
4. Chemistry

in decreasing order of priority.

I'll do my best to keep up with the summaries, and you can keep track of my schedule for these summaries here. However, I must warn you I am a busy and lazy human being, and so these summaries may not come to fruition.

## Olympiad and Research Math
I'm moderately fond of math olympiad stuff, despite how shit I am at it. If I find a cool problem, I'll write about it in the Cool-Problem-Diary, and if I learn some new interesting technqiues, I'll be sure to write about it. I've also been working on some olympiad handouts, and if I ever bother to finish them they'll go down on the olympiad section.

## Musing and Bruising
It's apparently a tradition for members of The Town to have random musings about stuff. I shall too, I guess.
