They will be organised as follows\n1. A PDF summary on the content in question for investigation/exam.\n    - Explained with aid of **examples from past papers/exams**.\n    - Breakdowns of question-types and how to approach various types.\n2. Past Papers\n    - List of past papers to try. (Hope you kept your hastily downloaded copy of WACE dungeon.)\n    - **Common errors** in the topic, and how to avoid them.\n    - **SCSA MARKING KEY BEHAVIOURS**\n3. Original Past Papers (written by Yours Truly)\n    - Complete with SCSA-like marking key behaviours.\n## Advice\nI know your time is short, so here is brief advice for ATMAM in general. In each test-section, I cover the common errors in greater depth, and how to avoid them. However, in general I'd like to stress some rather large pointers.\n1. \u003cbigg\u003e **READ!** \u003c/bigg\u003e\n    - Yes, I know. It's very common to go,\n    \u003e Oh I just made some silly reading mistakes. Can't be helped.\n\n    It sorta can be helped (ish). First **underline key info**. **Don't** be complacent and skim read. If you note down common things you misread, you can get better at avoiding them.\n2.  \u003cbigg\u003e **Marking Key Behaviours** \u003c/bigg\u003e\n    - Marking Key behaviours become very, very strict in Year 12. In particular, \u003cred\u003e**PMOD uses SCSA Marking Key**\u003c/red\u003e so you must study **WACE 2022**-style questions, and note their behaviours. Non-optional.\n    - Style of Questions: SCSA tries to standardise the kind of questions they will put in their assessments. Mr White happily follows these styles. **Know the MKB** of each style of question.\n3. \u003cbigg\u003e **Final touches** \u003c/bigg\u003e - We often screw up at the very last details.\n    - The most most common of these are **forgetting units**, **getting wrong units.** or the dreaded \u003cred\u003e**+C**\u003c/red\u003e\n        - Advice: Write a massive U on a question with units, and highlight/underline the unit needed. The 2nd bit is equally important. m/s or cm/s makes a big difference.\n4. \u003cbigg\u003e **Dealing with your calculator - Classpad Tips** \u003c/bigg\u003e\n    - Rule 1 of 1\n    \u003e Your classpad is more useful than you think\n\n    - **Stage 1:** Proficiency in Classpad functions. See [Charlie Watson's](https://charliewatson.com/) excellent website to get started.\n    - **Stage 2:** eActivity bonanza. We can automate many styles of questions that appear in WACE. See each test-section, which has a \u003corange\u003etutorial for a new Classpad e-activity\u003c/orange\u003e that I personally used for that test/investigation.\n5. \u003cbigg\u003e**Efficiency**\u003c/bigg\u003e\n    - Time pressure can become a deciding factor. Investigation 2 of 2023 was a good example.\n    - **Stage 1:** Working Out. When you understand the marking key behaviours you can get the exact right amount of working out to earn full marks. Moreover, when you grasp the \u003corange\u003estyle of question\u003c/orange\u003e - which I hope each summary helps achieve - you can get straight to writing.\n    - **Stage 2:** Calculator Use. Become familliar with using your Classpad whenever doing a calculator assumed test, and if using eActivities, get to know them well, well before the exam.\n6. \u003cbigg\u003e**Study Habits**\u003c/bigg\u003e\n    - In general, I'd recommend finishing off a topic 2-3 weeks before it is covered in class. That way, you can get right onto doing past-papers.\n        - Don't need to put off doing papers if you don't feel 100% confident.\n        - \u003cblue\u003eTip:\u003c/blue\u003e Sacrifice one practice paper to look through questions and marking key behaviours carefully. \n    - When you do past papers, don't just note down your score and move on. I recommend compiling an \u003corange\u003eerrors sheet\u003c/orange\u003e with all of your errors per paper. If notes are allowed, then **stick it on your notes**.\n    - Don't write lengthy notes with just test content...it's not an effective strategy.\n        - Exams allow 2 double-sided pages of notes. You should have the content so familliar from past papers that at least one double-sided page should just be \u003cblue\u003e **errors/questions you struggled** \u003c/blue\u003e with or \u003cpurple\u003e **marking key behaviours** \u003c/purple\u003e from past exams. If you have a notes page, write down **definitions** and maybe the most key formulae only.\n\n# READ THIS\nThe files in each summary section is not necessarily up to date.

Historical novels capture the details of the time period as accurately as possible for authenticity, including social norms, manners, customs, and traditions. Many novels in this genre tell fictional stories that involve actual historical figures or events.\n\nMakes an attempt at being historical accurate, despite the narrative being shaped, formed, partially imaginary.\n$\\implies$ still want to be **authentic** but uses imagination\n\n### Limits of the genre\n\"To be deemed historical (in our sense), a novel must have been written at least fifty years after the events described ,or have been written by someone who was not alive at the time of those events (who therefore approaches them only by research)\"- Historical novel society\n- **is this too much time? should be measured by how much perspectives has change, different perspectives should allow works to be consider historical as being seen from dif perspective - distance from subject, allowing objectivity**\n\n\"We also consider the following styles of novel to be historical fiction for our purposes\":\n- alternative histories \n\t- *Fatherland* Robert Harris\n- pseudo-histories\n\t- *Island of the Day Before* Umberto Eco\n- timeslip novels\n\t- *Lady of Hay* Barbara Erskine\n- historical fantasies\n\t- *King Arthur Trilogy* Bernard Cornwell\n- multiple-time novels\n\t- *The Hours* Michael Cunningham\n\t- *Orlando* Virginia Woolf\n\n### Historical Fiction: is it a paradox?\n\n**5 Common Elements of Historical Fiction (taken from masterclass.com)**\n- Setting:\n\t- The setting is the most important part of a historical fiction novel. It should take place during an authentic period in history and be set in a real historical place. \n- Plot: \n\t- The plot in a historical fiction novel is a combination of real events and fictional events. You can invent characters, cities, and events, but they still must make sense to the time period.\n- Characters:\n\t- The characters can be real, fictional, or both, but they should all look, speak, and act in ways that accurately reflect the era.\n- Dialogue:\n\t- The dialogue must be authentic to the time period and should reflect the status of the characters who are speaking\n\t- *Really important for a historical fiction piece to work*\n\t- **Use of idiom**\n\t- **Register** $\\implies$ reflect class, status, education\n\t- **Vernacular**\n\t- tldr we are trying to replicate the **language patterns** of the time period.\n\t- Tim Winton is apparently really good at this (for aussie lit)\n- Conflict:\n\t- The problems the characters encounter should be conflicts people of that era would encounter.\n\nFor a successful historical fiction, all these things should be **accurate to the period**!\n$\\implies$ we want to put ourselves in the perspective of the characters we are trying to convey - how do they see conflict for example\n\n### Are literature and history as antagonists?\n- History is about facts and time, while literature is about fiction and language.\n- In *The Order of Things*, Foucault argues that the relationship between literature and history might be more complicated than this binary suggests. He explains systems of understanding, including subjects or disciplines.\n\t- Yet we use **narrative** in both history and lit\n\t\t-  bias in hass,\n\t\t- objectivity/subjectivity in lit\n- The work of historian Hayden White follows this line of thinking. White points out that history is **intimately involved in the representation of prior events**.\n\t- Hayden White is a postcolonialist.\n- Hisory is always being made rather than something safely secured in what we might call and recall as the past. So, the practice of writing history relies on interpretation and representation, the very devices of fiction and fiction-reading.\n- White concluded, not uncontroversially, that \"history is no less a form of fiction than the novel is a form of historical representation\" (1987: 122). The historical record is a discursive entity, a selective account of events, responses and emotions, which is not to say that is fiction or untrue or unreal but rather that it is, to a degree, made up. \n- Literature, in turn, can bring into being (so the argument goes) that which the archive does not retain traces of\n\n- Historical record is flawed $\\implies$ gaps and silences\n- **Historical fiction supplements these gaps!**\n- Through knowledge of history, and goal of accuracy, we can recreate history within a fictional construction\n\t- Bringing to life something that was not recorded\n\n### Mantel's BBC Reith Lectures 2017: Lecture 4 \"Can These Bones Live\"\n\"In the Old Testament, God asked the prophet Ezekiel, 'Can these bones live?' He answered yes: and so do I. The task of historical fiction is to take the past outof the archive and relocate it in a body.\"\n\n- In this version of the Old Testament, God has a skeleton.\n- **Through historical fiction, can bring \"bones of history\" back to life. We can give the skeleton flesh (meaning??? or just elements of history).**\n\n### A dialogue with the past\n\"**Most historical fiction is, I like to think, in dialogue with the past.**\"\n\n- Communication between past and present\n- Analysing representation, we are trying to ponder how\n\t- dialogue is being constructed\n\t- how does this help us understand (history presumably)\n\n### A story of Australia\n- William Dampier wrote in 1688 that the country was waterless and 'the inhabitants \\[...\\] the miserablest people in the world', and went on to complain at length about the flies.\n\t- William Dampier had actually arrived at Australia at this time\n- Batavia\n\t- Gruesome moment in Aus History\n\t- Shipwreck on an island\n\t- Trying to get to Batavia/Java/Indonesia\n\t- Tried to send people to get help\n\t- Crew and other passengers stay on island\n\t- Mutiny\n\t- People killed, rape, death very sad\n\n### Colonial Australia\n*1788-1901*\n- Two different cultures:\n- Indigenous/'traditional' and European/Modern (try not to place this categories in opposition to each other - they are different, not always in opposition - **grey area**)\n- Different world views, different epistemologies\n- Different perspectives on nature, family, wealth, country, etc.\n- One recorded history.\n\n- **Trying to loot Australia for its resources (minerals etc.)**\n- Indigenous, Western stories kept separate, but now during Colonial Australia, these stories collide\n\t- Indigenous story suppressed\n\t- Western story officialised\n\n### Self-definition: redifining identity and a new nation\n- Lucky country\n- Isolated country\n- Egalitarian (???)\n- Brave\n- Brutal\n- Wealthy\n\n### Some traditional/dominant Australian identities and literary archetypes\n\n- Drover/Stockman\n- ANZAC\n- Lost child\n\t- Childhood innocence/ stupidity\n\t- Blackberries(the funny fruit poem)(blackcurrents?????)\n- Bushranger\n- Undergod/Battler\n- Bush versus City\n- Indigenous mystic\n\nAt this time, no **black vs white binary**\n- But mystical Indigenous figure\n\n**Are there stories missing?**\n- 90% (apparently)\n\n### Emerging Themes\n- The complications of belonging\n- Importance and consequences of historical truth - dealing with cultural guilt\n- Facing the limitations of the traditional Australian National identity\n- The connection between violence and masculinity\n- Connections between trauma of national experience\n- Achieving reconciliation and atonement\n- Indigenous self-determination\n\n- Now, we are **complicating** what it means to **belong** in Australia.\n- Cultural/collective **guilt**\n- Connection between *violence* and *masculinity*. Is this good? How does this make \"young men\" think (men üëç) \n- Referendum, we gotta think about these things\n\n- Limitations to the identity\n\n### Untitled powerpoint slide\nGenre texts essentialy ask the audience, \"Do you still want to believe this?\" Popularity is the audience answering, \"Yes\". Change in genres occurs when theaudience says, \"That's too infantile a form of what we believe. Show us something more complicated.\"\n*Leo Braudy, The World in a Frame, 1977*\n\n- Now, historical fiction **\"explodes\"**, we want to subvert stereotypes and misconceptions on Australian identity\n\n### How do they change? What becomes the method of complication?\n- Experiment within a genre\n- Revise, correct, deconstruct\n- Recreate or revisit\n\t-  Look through nostalgic lens\n\t- Pastiche\n- Parody\n- Blending\n- Altered representations\n- Altered perspectives\n\n### Contextual Complexity\n- The most important part\n\n- Are historical fictions about the past? \n- Or are they about the present?\n- They are about both!\n\t- Once again, we want something more complicated.\n- Most importantly, they are **a dialogue with the past**.\n\n### Australian Historical Fiction\n- A dialogue with people from specific moments in Australia's past\n\n### Cloudstreet and Realism\n\n**insert Tim Winton, p.1**\n\n- Realism through **vernacular**\n\t- We don't actually have perfect grammar, so we get a representation of Australian culture.\n\n- Realism mainly came out of Latin America\n- Magic realism $\\implies$ we take something unreal, otherworldy, infused with the **construction of realism**\n\n- Although magical elements aren't real, since they are placed next to real elements, we feel them to be more real.\n\n- Playing with narrative construction.\n\n**\"Back in time\"(35-36)**\n- Daisy Bates is a historical figure\n- Untrained anthropology\n\t- Focused on recording stories of Indigenous **women** in particular\n\n- Magic realism creates dialogue with past $\\implies$ australia is a haunted nation, through this we can talk about the past\n\n### Examples of magic realism in aus lit\n- No Sugar\n- The Secret River\n- That Deadman Dance\n\n- Placing the two cultures together, we get a dialogue\n- By analysing it, we construct our own dialogue\n\n## The rapper (Marksman Lloyd)\n**Different way of expressing ones self from a literature perspective**\n\n- Poet, performer\n\nSubverting social/family expectations - back then, rapping was cringe (still is today)\n\n- dont do tafe $(\\text{tafe suck(waste time(time waste(less mone(t=\\$(money))))))}$\nPerth mod good üëç, other schools bad üëé.\n\nMy g got jumped\n\nEshays cant take a joke\n\n## Ruby-Jean Hindley\n\nIndigenous perspectives across literature.\n\n### Presentation Thesis\nWhat I would like you all to consider:\n- In the vastness of indigenous australian history, colonisation is a drop in the ocean\n- Before colonisation became an inlfuence on indigenous experience, what other **thematic concerns** do you think they had?\n- The diversity in the indigenous experience (not solely formed by trauma)\n\nWhat I would like you all to gain from this presentation:\n- A more developed sense of diversity\n- An understanding of the thematic conflict that exists in Indigenous perspectives and story-telling\n- (Hopefully) how to embed those perspectives in writing\n- A developed appreciation of Indigenous voices and how they are marginalised\n- An ability to effectively analyse and engage with indigenous voices and perspectives in your writing.\n\n### Your presenter today\n- English and Hass teacher 9 years\n- Aranmore Catholic Colledge 10th% indigneous student population\n- Born raised in perth\n- Noongar +Yamaji\n- **Immediate family is non-Indigenous**\n- **All schooling and employment has been in predominantly non-Indigenous places.**\n- Mother - a white woman - having a black child $\\implies$ what are the assumptions made of her?\n\n### Acknowledgements of Country\n1. Why do we have acknowledgements of country?\n2. What is the difference between a welcome to country and an acknowledgement of country?\n\t- Welcome to country can only be done by an elder.\n3. Why is it important to have a welcome to country?\n\t- Accept and acknowledge elders $\\implies$ give them the right to welcome to country\n\t- i.e. you wouldn't like your neighbours inviting someone random to your house.\n\nWe say Indigenous **language groups** (not tribes etc.)\n\n- In comparison to **New Zealand**, Indigenous language is actually taught.\n\n### The coloniser's perspective\n- Why did the stolen generation happen?\n- Why did government feel the need to intervene?\n- From what perspective or even emotion did these policies come from?\n- **\"[T]hey have to be protected against themselves whether they like it or not.

Neville was the \"Chief Protector\", meaning he was the **legal guardian of Indigenous children**, not their parents!\n\n- **How much of our identity, do we determine for ourselves? How much of Indigenous Australians' identity been determined by themselves, versus by Western society**.\n- Lost identity, stolen identity, kids taken from parents, language groups land.\n\t- How do we then know about the people, the land, if **we don't know ourselves**?\n- History of Aboriginal Australians is full of trauma, which leads to **loss of identity**\n\n### The Indigenous Perspective\n*The Stolen Generation (approx. 1890-1970)*\n\n**\"I have no identity, really.\" - Cynthia Sariago (daughter of a stolen women)**\n\n**\"We never heard the words 'I love you', so we never learned to say them to our family... or feel them. We became empty vessels, out of touch with our feelings.\" - Sharyn Egan**\n\n**\"My mother did not bond with her mother and I did not bond with mine.\" - Barbara Cummings**\n\n**\"I was hurting and had found no way of safely healing the pain... I couldn't see any hope in the future.\" - Joy Makepeace, taken aged less than 1 yr old.**\n\n- The \"Bringing them Home Report\", 1997.\n\n- *If we can't name or learn our feelings, we cannot express them.*\n- Good story telling engages us because we can relate to the story, what the characters are going through. If you don't know yourself/identity is hollow or fragmented, **how can we engage with the characters**?\n- To make connections with Indigenous text, we must understand the contention, and the dual perspectives.\n\n\n### The first indication of civilisation?\n*Dr. Margaret Mead (1901-1978), Cultural Anthropologist*\n\nWhen asked about the first sign of Human civilisation she answered: \"A 15,000 year old healed femur.\"\n\nA **healed** femur bone showed:\n- Someone cared for the injured person\n- Someone did their hunting and gathering\n- Someone stayed with them for companionship and protection, possibly at their own risk.\n\nThe assumption made is that the first sign of civilisation was compassion/selflessness, considering your own survival as a secondary priority.\n\n### The first indication of humanity\n\nLake Mungo remains\n- 40-42k years old\n- First known example of **ritual burial and cremation**\n\nThis showed:\n- Someone cared enough for the deceased to ensure a proper process was followed\n- Someone thought that there was some aspect of a higher power/God\n- The area where the deceased was found holds some significance (cnnection or importance)\n- Someone thought that there was some manifestation of life after death\n- Someone either stayed at or continued to return to the burial or cremation site\n\n- Indigenous perspectives run similar to Western/established perspectives\n- Yet, Indigenous storytelling is not given the same level of importance/credence\n\n### Song lines (indigenous cultural element)\n\nWhat are song lines?\n- Geographical, Astronomically aligned, logistical, spiritual, narrative maps.\n- Part of \"Lore\" training and education as well as initiation of elders.\n- Part of the \"adolescence of Indigenous culture\".\n- Acoord to Noel Pearson they are Australia's \"Book of Genesis\".\n\t- Creation stories\n\t- https://www.commonground.org.au/learn/songlines\n\n\"The Song lines shouldn't be just an anthropological footnote, but a part of Australian history as it is taught in schools. To tell the real story of this continent, you've got to have both histories. They are held in different ways, told in different ways, but are essentially complementary.

Why don't we lift Indigenous stories to the same level?\n\n#### Another song line\n- **Fanny Balbuk, 1840-1907**\n\t- Told her story a lot\n\n### No Sugar\nSet during the Great Depression, post-colonial Northam, WA, Moore River Native Settlement and Perth.\n\nFollows the story of the Millimurra (an Aborigial Australian family) and their struggle for survival.\n\nAct 2, Scene 6: The Corroboree Scene\n- What have we identified from this scene?\n- What language conventions, devices, styles, themes?\n- What narrative conventions; conflict, characterisation, setting?\n- What conventions of genre in terms of form? What do we expect from a play?\n\nQuestion: **How jarring is it for a white audience to watch a Corroboree?

You can find the bulk of the configuration scattered throughout the repository depending on how in-depth you'd like to get.\n\nThe majority of configuration can be found under `data/config.yaml`. An annotated example configuration is shown below.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# The name to display in the footer\nname: Jacky Zhao\n\n# whether to globally show the table of contents on each page\n# this can be turned off on a per-page basis by adding this to the\n# front-matter of that note\nenableToc: true\n\n# whether to by-default open or close the table of contents on each page\nopenToc: false\n\n# whether to display on-hover link preview cards\nenableLinkPreview: true\n\n# whether to render titles for code blocks\nenableCodeBlockTitle: true \n\n# whether to render copy buttons for code blocks\nenableCodeBlockCopy: true \n\n# whether to render callouts\nenableCallouts: true\n\n# whether to try to process Latex\nenableLatex: true\n\n# whether to enable single-page-app style rendering\n# this prevents flashes of unstyled content and improves\n# smoothness of Quartz.

Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems? Checkout our [FAQ and Troubleshooting guide](notes/troubleshooting.md).\n\n## Language Support\n[CJK + Latex Support (ÊµãËØï)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(ÊµãËØï).md) comes out of the box with Quartz.\n\nWant to support languages that read from right-to-left (like Arabic)? Hugo (and by proxy, Quartz) supports this natively.\n\nFollow the steps [Hugo provides here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#configure-languages) and modify your `config.toml`\n\nFor example:\n\n```toml\ndefaultContentLanguage = 'ar'\n[languages]\n  [languages.ar]\n    languagedirection = 'rtl'\n    title = 'ŸÖÿØŸàŸÜÿ™Ÿä'\n    weight = 1\n```\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-06T11:35:40.998189705Z","tags":["setup"]},"/notes/custom-Domain":{"title":"Custom Domain","content":"\n### Registrar\nThis step is only applicable if you are using a **custom domain**!

You should set the environment variable `HUGO_BASEURL=http://your-public-ip` and then start your container.\n2. Set up port forwarding on your router from port `p` to `your-local-ip:1313`.\n3. You should now be able to access Quartz from outside your local network at `http://your-public-ip:p`.\n\nHowever, your HTTP connection will be unencrypted and **this method is not secure**.\n\n### To a Domain using Cloudflare Proxy\n\n1. Port forward 443 (HTTPS) from your machine.\n2. Buy a custom domain (say, `your-domain.com`) from [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/). Point a DNS A record from `your-domain.com` to your public IP address and enable the proxy.\n3. Set the environment variables `HUGO_BASEURL=https://your-domain.com`, `HUGO_PORT=443`, and `HUGO_APPENDPORT=false`. Change `1313:1313` to `443:443` for the `ports` in `docker-compose.yml`.\n4. Spin up your Quartz container and enjoy it at `https://your-domain.com`!\n\n### To a Domain using a Reverse Proxy\n\nIf you want to serve more than just Quartz to the internet on this machine (or don't want to use the Cloudflare registrar and proxy), you should follow the steps in the section above (as appropriate) and also set up a reverse proxy, like [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik).

If you forked and cloned Quartz directly from the repository, everything should already be good to go! Follow the steps below.\n\n### Enable GitHub Actions Permissions\nBy default, GitHub disables workflows from modifying your files (for good reason!). However, Quartz needs this to write the actual site files back to GitHub.\n\nHead to `Settings \u003e Action \u003e General \u003e Workflow Permissions` and choose `Read and Write Permissions`\n\n![[notes/images/github-actions.png]]\n*Enable GitHub Actions*\n\n### Enable GitHub Pages\n\nHead to the 'Settings' tab of your forked repository and go to the 'Pages' tab.\n\n1.

Set a custom domain here if you have one!\n\n![Enable GitHub Pages](/notes/images/github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\n\n### Pushing Changes\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Quartz is a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as if it were just a regular software project.\n\n```shell\n# Navigate to Quartz folder\ncd \u003cpath-to-quartz\u003e\n\n# Commit all changes\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"message describing changes\"\n\n# Push to GitHub to update site\ngit push origin hugo\n```\n\nNote: we specifically push to the `hugo` branch here. Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`. \n\nMake sure that your `baseURL` has a trailing `/`!\n\n[Reference `config.toml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/config.toml)\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e/\"\n```\n\nIf you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. `\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz`), include the trailing `/`. **You need to do this especially if you are using GitHub!**\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz/\"\n```\n\nChange `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\nPlease note that the `cname` field should *not* have any path `e.g. end with /quartz` or have a trailing `/`.\n\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n```yaml {title=\".github/workflows/deploy.yaml\"}\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \n\tpublish_branch: master\n\tcname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\n\nHave a custom domain?

This is easier to setup but usually produces lower quality matches.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nenableSemanticSearch: false\n```\n\n## Natural Language\nNatural language search is powered by [Operand](https://beta.operand.ai/). It understands language like a person does and finds results that best match user intent. In this sense, it is closer to how Google Search works.\n\nNatural language search tends to produce higher quality results than full-text search.\n\nHere's how to set it up.\n\n1. Login or Register for a new Operand account. Click the verification link sent to your email, and you'll be redirected to the dashboard. (Note) You do not need to enter a credit card to create an account, or get started with the Operand API. The first $10 of usage each month is free. To learn more, see pricing. If you go over your free quota, we'll (politely) reach out and ask you to configure billing.\n2. Create your first index. On the dashboard, under \"Indexes\", enter the name and description of your index, and click \"Create Index\". Note down the ID of the index (obtained by clicking on the index name in the list of indexes), as you'll need it in the next step. IDs are unique to each index, and look something like `uqv1duxxbdxu`.\n3. Click into the index you've created. Under \"Index Something\", select \"SITEMAP\" from the dropdown and click \"Add Source\".\n4. For the \"Sitemap.xml URL\", put your deployed site's base URL followed by `sitemap.xml`. For example, for `quartz.jzhao.xyz`, put `https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/sitemap.xml`. Leave the URL Regex empty. \n5. Get your API key. On the dashboard, under \"API Keys\", you can manage your API keys. If you don't already have an API key, click \"Create API Key\". You'll need this for the next step.\n6. Open `data/config.yaml`. Set `enableSemanticSearch` to `true`, `operandApiKey` to your copied key, and `operandIndexId` to the ID of the index we created from earlier..\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nsearch:\n  enableSemanticSearch: true\n  operandApiKey: \"jp9k5hudse2a828z98kxd6z3payi8u90rnjf\"\n  operandIndexId: \"s0kf3bd6tldw\"\n```\n7.

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (ÊµãËØï)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(ÊµãËØï).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile (~/.zshrc if you are on Mac)\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile # again, (~/.zshrc if you are on Mac)\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup analytics?\nQuartz by default uses [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) for analytics. \n\nIf you would prefer to use Google Analytics, you can follow this [guide in the Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/templates/internal/#google-analytics). \n\nAlternatively, you can also import your Google Analytics data into Plausible by [following this guide](https://plausible.io/docs/google-analytics-import).\n\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect!

Usually you should press `y` for most of these unless it conflicts with existing changes you've made! \n\n```shell\nmake update\n```\n\nOr, if you don't want the interactive parts and just want to force update your local garden (this assumed that you are okay with some of your personalizations been overriden!)\n\n```shell\nmake update-force\n```\n\nOr, manually checkout the changes yourself.\n\n\u003e [!warning] Warning!\n\u003e\n\u003e If you customized the files in `data/`, or anything inside `layouts/`, your customization may be overwritten!\n\u003e Make sure you have a copy of these changes if you don't want to lose them.\n\n\n```shell\n# add Quartz as a remote host\ngit remote add upstream git@github.com:jackyzha0/quartz.git\n\n# index and fetch changes\ngit fetch upstream\ngit checkout -p upstream/hugo -- layouts .github Makefile assets/js assets/styles/base.scss assets/styles/darkmode.scss config.toml data \n```\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-06T11:35:41.002189638Z","tags":[]}}
