Please see the [Mascochism Tango](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TytGOeiW0aE) by Tom Lehrer for further information.

# Overview
In this page, there **will be** prep material for every single test, investigation and exam I took in 2023. They will be organised as follows
1. A PDF summary on the content in question for investigation/exam.
    - Explained with aid of **examples from past papers/exams**.
    - Breakdowns of question-types and how to approach various types.
2. Past Papers
    - List of past papers to try. (Hope you kept your hastily downloaded copy of WACE dungeon.)
    - **Common errors** in the topic, and how to avoid them.
    - **SCSA MARKING KEY BEHAVIOURS**
3. Original Past Papers (written by Yours Truly)
    - Complete with SCSA-like marking key behaviours.
# Advice
This section is more brief advice. In each test, I cover the common errors in greater depth, and how to avoid them. However, in general I'd like to stress some rather large pointers.
1. **READ!**
2. **Final touches**
3. **Classpad**
4. **Efficiency**
5. **Study Habits**

# Textbook Plans
By the time I have finished creating all these summaries, original past papers and advice I think I'll have close to a book. Hopefully I'll get to make one.
