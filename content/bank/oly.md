### My curiosity with unsolved prime conjectures

There's a huge number of fascinating problems regarding the prime numbers that are still open problems, or were fiendishly hard to solve. See Prime Numbers The Most Mysterious Figures in Math by David Wells to see some of these results. I've been particularly interested in <orange>Legendre's Conjecture</orange>, <red>Twin-Prime Conjecture</red>, Landau's $n^2+1$ primes, <blue>Goldbach conjecture</blue>. Hopefully one of these gets proven before I die.

Legendre and Goldbach hopefully ought to be pretty close to being solved, given that bounds are getting tighter.

### An interesting heuristic on why PNT is true
I found this from some random document on a Harvard physics course. <a href=https://www.physics.harvard.edu/files/sol18.pdf>Click here buddy</a>

Thanks to Euclid, we know that $N$ is prime $\iff$ $\nexists p \mid N$ for all $p < \sqrt{N}$.

We note that whether two separate primes $p$ and $q$ divide a number is `independent'. Therefore, let us consider the probability $P(N)$ that a number *of the size* $N$ is prime.
$$P(N) = (1-\frac{1}{p_1})(1-\frac{1}{p_2})\cdots(1-\frac{1}{p_k})$$
where $p_1 < p_2 < \cdots < p_k$ are the primes less than or equal to $N$.
