## Why are the primes so hard?

There's a huge number of fascinating problems regarding the prime numbers that are still open problems, or were fiendishly hard to solve. See Prime Numbers The Most Mysterious Figures in Math by David Wells to see some of these results. I've been particularly interested in <blue>Legendre's Conjecture</blue>, <red>Twin-Prime Conjecture</red>, Landau's $n^2+1$ primes, Goldbach. Hopefully one of these gets proven before I die.

Legendre ought to be pretty close given that $n^3$ and $(n+1)^3$ have also been proved.

## An interesting heuristic on why PNT is true
I found this from some random document on a Harvard physics course. <a href=https://www.physics.harvard.edu/files/sol18.pdf>Click here buddy</a>
