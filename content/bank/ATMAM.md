## Why am I doing this?
Please see the [Mascochism Tango](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TytGOeiW0aE) by Tom Lehrer for further information.

## Overview
In this page, there **will be** prep material for  <blue>every single test, investigation and exam</blue> I took in 2023. They will be organised as follows
1. A PDF summary on the content in question for investigation/exam.
    - Explained with aid of **examples from past papers/exams**.
    - Breakdowns of question-types and how to approach various types.
2. Past Papers
    - List of past papers to try. (Hope you kept your hastily downloaded copy of WACE dungeon.)
    - **Common errors** in the topic, and how to avoid them.
    - **SCSA MARKING KEY BEHAVIOURS**
3. Original Past Papers (written by Yours Truly)
    - Complete with SCSA-like marking key behaviours.
## Advice
I know your time is short, so here is brief advice for ATMAM in general. In each test-section, I cover the common errors in greater depth, and how to avoid them. However, in general I'd like to stress some rather large pointers.
1. **READ!**
    - Yes, I know. It's very common to go,
    > Oh I just made some silly reading mistakes. Can't be helped.
    It sorta can be helped (ish). First **underline key info**. **Don't** be complacent and skim read. 
2. **Marking Key Behaviours**
    - Marking Key behaviours become very, very strict in Year 12. In particular, **PMOD uses SCSA Marking Key** so you must study **WACE 2022**. Non-optional.
    - Style of Questions: SCSA tries to standardise the kind of questions they will put in their assessments. Mr White happily follows these styles. **Know the MKB** of each style of question.
3. **Final touches** - We often screw up at the very last drtail.
    - The most most common of these are **forgetting units** or **getting wrong units.** 
        - Advice: Write a massive U on a question with units, and highlight/underline the unit needed. The 2nd bit is equally important. m/s or cm/s makes a big difference.
4. **Dealing with your calculator - Classpad Tips**
    - Rule 1 of 1
    > Your classpad is more useful than you think
    - **Stage 1:** Proficiency in Classpad functions. See [Charlie Watson's](https://charliewatson.com/) excellent website to get started.
    - **Stage 2:** eActivity bonanza. We can automate many styles of questions that appear in WACE.
5. **Efficiency**
    - Time pressure can become a deciding factor. Investigation 2 of 2023 was a good example.
    - **Stage 1:** Working Out. When you understand the marking key behaviours you can get the exact right amount of working out to earn full marks. Moreover, when you grasp the style of question - which I hope each summary helps achieve - you can get straight to writing.
    - **Stage 2:** Calculator Use. Become familliar with using your Classpad whenever doing a calculator assumed, and if using eActivities, get to know them well, well before the exam.
6. **Study Habits**

## Textbook Plans
By the time I have finished creating all these summaries, original past papers and advice I think I'll have close to a book. Hopefully I'll get to publish one?
