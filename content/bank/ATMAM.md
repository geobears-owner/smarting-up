## Overview
In this page, there **will be** prep material for  <blue> **every single test, investigation and exam** </blue> I took in 2023. They will be organised as follows
1. A PDF summary on the content in question for investigation/exam.
    - Explained with aid of **examples from past papers/exams**.
    - Breakdowns of question-types and how to approach various types.
2. Past Papers
    - List of past papers to try. (Hope you kept your hastily downloaded copy of WACE dungeon.)
    - **Common errors** in the topic, and how to avoid them.
    - **SCSA MARKING KEY BEHAVIOURS**
3. Original Past Papers (written by Yours Truly)
    - Complete with SCSA-like marking key behaviours.
## Advice
I know your time is short, so here is brief advice for ATMAM in general. In each test-section, I cover the common errors in greater depth, and how to avoid them. However, in general I'd like to stress some rather large pointers.
1. <bigg> **READ!** </bigg>
    - Yes, I know. It's very common to go,
    > Oh I just made some silly reading mistakes. Can't be helped.

    It sorta can be helped (ish). First **underline key info**. **Don't** be complacent and skim read. If you note down common things you misread, you can get better at avoiding them.
2.  <bigg> **Marking Key Behaviours** </bigg>
    - Marking Key behaviours become very, very strict in Year 12. In particular, <red>**PMOD uses SCSA Marking Key**</red> so you must study **WACE 2022**-style questions, and note their behaviours. Non-optional.
    - Style of Questions: SCSA tries to standardise the kind of questions they will put in their assessments. Mr White happily follows these styles. **Know the MKB** of each style of question.
3. <bigg> **Final touches** </bigg> - We often screw up at the very last details.
    - The most most common of these are **forgetting units**, **getting wrong units.** or the dreaded <red>**+C**</red>
        - Advice: Write a massive U on a question with units, and highlight/underline the unit needed. The 2nd bit is equally important. m/s or cm/s makes a big difference.
4. <bigg> **Dealing with your calculator - Classpad Tips** </bigg>
    - Rule 1 of 1
    > Your classpad is more useful than you think

    - **Stage 1:** Proficiency in Classpad functions. See [Charlie Watson's](https://charliewatson.com/) excellent website to get started.
    - **Stage 2:** eActivity bonanza. We can automate many styles of questions that appear in WACE. See each test-section, which has a <orange>tutorial for a new Classpad e-activity</orange> that I personally used for that test/investigation.
5. <bigg>**Efficiency**</bigg>
    - Time pressure can become a deciding factor. Investigation 2 of 2023 was a good example.
    - **Stage 1:** Working Out. When you understand the marking key behaviours you can get the exact right amount of working out to earn full marks. Moreover, when you grasp the <orange>style of question</orange> - which I hope each summary helps achieve - you can get straight to writing.
    - **Stage 2:** Calculator Use. Become familliar with using your Classpad whenever doing a calculator assumed test, and if using eActivities, get to know them well, well before the exam.
6. <bigg>**Study Habits**</bigg>
    - In general, I'd recommend finishing off a topic 2-3 weeks before it is covered in class. That way, you can get right onto doing past-papers.
        - Don't need to put off doing papers if you don't feel 100% confident.
        - <blue>Tip:</blue> Sacrifice one practice paper to look through questions and marking key behaviours carefully. 
    - When you do past papers, don't just note down your score and move on. I recommend compiling an <orange>errors sheet</orange> with all of your errors per paper. If notes are allowed, then **stick it on your notes**.
    - Don't write lengthy notes with just test content...it's not an effective strategy.
        - Exams allow 2 double-sided pages of notes. You should have the content so familliar from past papers that at least one double-sided page should just be <blue> **errors/questions you struggled** </blue> with or <purple> **marking key behaviours** </purple> from past exams. If you have a notes page, write down **definitions** and maybe the most key formulae only.

# READ THIS
The files in each summary section is not necessarily up to date. I am continually working and reviewing the content. I write my work on Overleaf, and upload the PDFs here, but it takes time. If you want to see the latest version, go onto <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/read/vrsnzmptspks">this link</a>, where all the summaries are being compiled into a "textbook-like" document. 

You <blue> will need an overleaf account.</blue>

By the time I have finished creating all these summaries, original past papers and advice I think I'll have close to a book. Hopefully I'll get to publish one?
